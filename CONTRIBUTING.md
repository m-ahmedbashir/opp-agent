# Contributing to Unstructured-to-Ops Action Agent

Thanks for considering a contribution. This is a solo-maintained project, but it's built and documented as if it weren't — issues, PRs, and questions are genuinely welcome.

## Getting set up

Follow [Getting Started in the README](README.md#️-getting-started) to install dependencies, configure environment variables, and run both apps locally. The short version:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Before opening a PR

Run these from the repo root — both are wired through Turborepo and are the exact commands CI runs on every push:

```bash
pnpm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit across every workspace
pnpm test            # backend unit tests (Jest)
```

A PR that fails either of these won't be merged as-is — please get them green first (or explain in the PR description why not, if there's a good reason).

`pnpm run lint` exists but is currently broken in the frontend workspace (see "good first issues" below) — don't rely on it yet.

## What to work on

- Check [open issues](https://github.com/m-ahmedbashir/opp-agent/issues) first. If nothing's filed for what you want to do, open one before sending a large PR, so we can agree on approach before you invest the time.
- The README's [Roadmap](README.md#-roadmap) section lists concrete, scoped next steps — each one there is deliberately sized to be a single PR, not an epic.
- **Good first issues** (small, well-defined, verified-broken so you won't waste time confirming the bug first):
  - **Fix frontend linting.** `apps/frontend`'s `lint` script is `next lint`, which no longer exists as of Next.js 16 (`next --help` lists no `lint` subcommand). Running `eslint` directly against the legacy `.eslintrc.json` also fails (`TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON`, from the `next/core-web-vitals` config under the installed `eslint@8.48.0` + `@eslint/eslintrc@2.1.4`). Needs a real migration to ESLint flat config, not a one-line patch.
  - Add a CI status badge to the README once `.github/workflows/ci.yml` has run a few times on `main`.
  - `generateObject`/`streamObject` in place of the manual `JSON.parse` in `extraction.service.ts`.
  - A provider-agnostic model registry so extraction isn't hard-wired to Groq.
- Found a bug that isn't listed above or in the Roadmap? Open an issue with repro steps — a failing test that demonstrates it is even better.

## Code style

- TypeScript everywhere; keep new code typed as strictly as the surrounding file already is — avoid introducing new `any` where the existing code has real types.
- Match the existing pattern in a file rather than introducing a new one (e.g. NestJS services stay thin, Zod schemas stay `.strict()`, React components stay in the existing feature-folder structure).
- Prettier handles formatting (`pnpm --filter frontend format`, `pnpm --filter backend format`) — don't hand-format around it.
- No enforced commit message convention yet — just write a message that explains *why*, not just *what*.

## Reporting a security issue

Please don't open a public issue for anything that looks like a real vulnerability (auth bypass, PII leak, secret exposure). Email the maintainer directly instead — contact details are on the [GitHub profile](https://github.com/m-ahmedbashir).

## Code of Conduct
