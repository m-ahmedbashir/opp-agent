 * score means the same thing regardless of what's being extracted.
 */
const CONFIDENCE_RUBRIC = `CONFIDENCE SCORING — use ONLY these six exact values for every confidence field, nothing in between:

1.0 — The exact value is explicitly printed/written in the document. You read it directly with no interpretation needed.
0.8 — The value is present but required minor interpretation: e.g. handwriting, abbreviation, non-standard date format, or reconstructing a total from other fields.
0.6 — The value is partially visible or you inferred it from strong surrounding context.
0.4 — The value is not clearly stated. You estimated it from weak indirect evidence and another reader might reach a different answer.
0.2 — You guessed. The document gives almost no reliable signal for this field.
0.0 — The field value is null (not found), OR you have no defensible basis for the extracted value.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- You MUST use only: 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, or 1.0. No other values.
- If a field is null (or an empty array), its confidence MUST be 0.0.
- Be honest. A document that is scanned, handwritten, or photographed at an angle should produce lower scores than a clean digital original.`;

const IMAGE_PII_CHECK = `IMAGE PII CHECK — only relevant when one or more images were provided:
- Set imagePiiDetected to true if the image(s) visibly show a personal email address, phone number, IBAN/bank account number, or credit/debit card number ANYWHERE in the frame — including outside the structured fields being extracted (e.g. in a footer, signature, stamp, or handwritten margin note).
- Routine business contact info in a normal document header does not need to be flagged; use judgement for anything that reads as a private individual's personal detail rather than routine business letterhead.
- If no image was provided at all, set imagePiiDetected to false.`;

For any field you cannot locate in the document, set it to null (or an empty array for list fields).
